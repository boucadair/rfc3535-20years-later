              draft-ietf-nmop-rfc3535-20years-later-latest

Abstract

   The IAB organized an important workshop to establish a dialog between
   network operators and protocol developers, and to guide the IETF
   focus on work regarding network management.  The outcome of that
   workshop was documented in the "IAB Network Management Workshop" (RFC
   3535) which was instrumental for developing NETCONF and YANG, in
   particular.

   20 years later, it is time to evaluate what has been achieved since
   then and identify the operational barriers for making these
   technologies widely implemented.  Also, this document captures new
   requirements for network management operations.

1.  Introduction

   The IAB organized a workshop (June 4-June 6, 2002) to establish a
   dialog between network operators and protocol developers, and to
   guide the IETF to focus on work regarding network management.  The
   outcome of that workshop was documented in the "IAB Network
   Management Workshop" [RFC3535] which was instrumental for developing
   NETCONF [RFC6241] and YANG [RFC6020][RFC7950].

   Since the publication of [RFC3535] major advances were achieved in
   the Network Managment area, such as (but not limited to):

   *  NETCONF [RFC6241]

   *  YANG [RFC7950]

   *  RESTCONF [RFC8040]

   *  SDN & Programmable Networks [RFC7149][RFC7426]

   *  Automation [RFC8969]

   *  Virtualization [RFC8568]

   *  Containerization [I-D.ietf-bmwg-containerized-infra]

   *  Intent-based [RFC9315]

   *  Network APIs

   *  Models for management of services, networks, and devices
      [RFC8199][RFC8309]

   *  Telemetry [RFC9232]

   *  JSON Encoding of Data Modeled with YANG [RFC7951]

   *  CoAP Management Interface (CORECONF) [I-D.ietf-core-comi]

   *  YANG to CBOR mapping [RFC9254]

   *  YANG Schema Item iDentifier (YANG SID) [I-D.ietf-core-sid]

   See also "An Overview of the IETF Network Management Standards"
   [RFC6632].

   More than 20 years later, new requirements on network management
   operations are emerging from the operators.  This document captures
   these requirements that reflect the progress in this area.

   The document also provide an assessment of the RFC3535
   recommendations (Section 2) and to what extend that roadmap was
   driving network management efforts within the IETF (Section 3).

2.  Assessment of RFC 3535 Operator Requirements

2.1.  Detailed Analysis

   Section 3 of [RFC3535] includes the following recommendations:

   3535-OPS-REQ-EASE-USE:

   |      Ease of use is a key requirement for any network management
   |        technology from the operators point of view.

   *Status Update*:  This is still a valid requirement.  It is even
      exacerbated with the amount of techniques and extensions that were
      specified since then.

   3535-OPS-REQ-CONFIG-OPS-SEPARATE:

 |   It is necessary to make a clear distinction between configuration
 |     data, data that describes operational state and statistics.  Some
 |     devices make it very hard to determine which parameters were
 |     administratively configured and which were obtained via other
 |     mechanisms such as routing protocols.

   *Status Update*:  This requirement was taken into account when
      designing IETF solutions.  Specifically, datastores are a
      fundamental concept in NETCONF/YANG (e.g., [RFC8342].

   3535-OPS-REQ-CONFIG-OPS-FETCH-SEPARATE:

   |   It is required to be able to fetch separately configuration data,
   |     operational state data, and statistics from devices, and to be
   |     able to compare these between devices.

   *Status Update*:  This is supported by NETCONF and RESTCONF.

   3535-OPS-REQ-NETWORK-NOT-DEVICE:

   |    It is necessary to enable operators to concentrate on the
   |      configuration of the network as a whole rather than individual
   |      devices.

   *Status Update*:  Protocols such as NETCONF supports means to handle
      transactions at the level of a network.  For example, a controller
      can establish parallel sessions with a set of devices and make use
      of confirmed commit.

      Also, [RFC8969] describes how YANG/RESTONF/YANG can be used to
      manage a network and map it to involves underlying functions/
      nodes.  Several service and network data models are required for
      this aim.

      The IETF defined in the past models to manage few servcies such as
      VPN at both service and network levels (e.g., the Layer 2 Service
      Model (L2SM) [RFC8466], the Layer 3 Service Model (L3SM)
      [RFC8299], the Layer 2 Network Model (L2NM) [RFC9291], and the
      Layer 3 Network Model (L3NM) [RFC9182]).

      A similar effort is currently ongoing for handling attachement
      circuits at both service and network layers (e.g.,
      [I-D.ietf-opsawg-teas-attachment-circuit],
      [I-D.ietf-opsawg-ntw-attachment-circuit]).

      More effort is still needed in this area.

   3535-OPS-REQ-NETWORK-WIDE-TRANSACTIONS:

   |   Support for configuration transactions across a number of devices
   |     would significantly simplify network configuration management.

   *Status Update*:  This feature is supported by NETCONF.

   3535-OPS-REQ-CONFIG-DIFF:

 |   Given configuration A and configuration B, it should be possible
 |     to generate the operations necessary to get from A to B with
 |     minimal state changes and effects on network and systems.  It is
 |     important to minimize the impact caused by configuration changes.

   *Status Update*:  This feature is supported by NETCONF.

   3535-OPS-REQ-CONFIG-DUMP-RESTORE:

 |   A mechanism to dump and restore configurations is a primitive
 |     operation needed by operators.  Standards for pulling and pushing
 |     configurations from/to devices are desirable.

   *Status Update*:  This feature is supported by NETCONF.

   3535-OPS-REQ-CONFIG-CONSISTENCY-CHECK:

   |     It must be easy to do consistency checks of configurations over
   |       time and between the ends of a link in order to determine the
   |       changes between two configurations and whether those
   |       configurations are consistent.

   *Status Update*:  A mechanism is specified in [RFC9144].

   3535-OPS-REQ-CONFIG-NETWORK-WIDE-SCHEMA:

  |   Network wide configurations are typically stored in central
  |     master databases and transformed into formats that can be pushed
  |     to devices, either by generating sequences of CLI commands or
  |     complete configuration files that are pushed to devices.  There
  |     is no common database schema for network configuration, although
  |     the models used by various operators are probably very similar.
  |     It is desirable to extract, document, and standardize the common
  |     parts of these network wide configuration database schemas.

   *Status Update*:  Covered by current implementations.

   3535-OPS-REQ-TXT-PROCESSING-TOOLS:

   |   It is highly desirable that text processing tools such as diff,
   |     and version management tools such as RCS or CVS, can be used to
   |     process configurations, which implies that devices should not
   |     arbitrarily reorder data such as access control lists.

   *Status Update*:  This is deployment-specific.

   3535-OPS-REQ-ACCESS-CONTROL-OPS-CENTRIC:

   |   The granularity of access control needed on management interfaces
   |     needs to match operational needs.  Typical requirements are a
   |     role-based access control model and the principle of least
   |     privilege, where a user can be given only the minimum access
   |     necessary to perform a required task.

   *Status Update*:  Role-based Access Control (RBAC) is supported by
      existing implementation.  Also, the IETF defined [RFC8341] for
      this purpose.

   3535-OPS-REQ-ACCESS-CONTROL-CHECKS:

   |      It must be possible to do consistency checks of access control
   |        lists across devices.

   *Status Update*:  This is implementation-specific.

   3535-OPS-REQ-CONFIG-SEPARATE-DISTRIB-ACTIV:

   |     It is important to distinguish between the distribution of
   |       configurations and the activation of a certain configuration.
   |       Devices should be able to hold multiple configurations.

   *Status Update*:  This is supported by existing NETCONF methods.

   3535-OPS-REQ-ACCESS-CONTROL-BOTH-DATA-TASK:

 |   SNMP access control is data-oriented, while CLI access control is
 |     usually command (task) oriented.  Depending on the management
 |     function, sometimes data-oriented or task-oriented access control
 |     makes more sense.  As such, it is a requirement to support both
 |     data-oriented and task-oriented access control.

   *Status Update*:  This is supported by [RFC8341].

3.  Assessment of RFC 3535 Recommendations

3.1.  Detailed Analysis

   Section 6 of [RFC3535] includes the following recommendations:

   3535-RECO-STOP-MANDATE-MIB:

  |   The workshop recommended that the IETF stop forcing working groups
  |     to provide writable MIB modules.  It should be the decision of
  |     the working group whether they want to provide writable objects
  |     or not.

   *Status Update*:  In 2014, the IESG published a statement Writable
      MIB Module, which states that:

         SNMP MIB modules creating and modifying configuration state
         should only be produced by working groups in cases of clear
         utility and consensus to use SNMP write operations for
         configuration, and in consultation with the OPS ADs/MIB
         doctors.

   3535-RECO-MIB-INVESTIGATE:

  |   The workshop recommended that a group be formed to investigate why
  |     current MIB modules do not contain all the objects needed by
  |     operators to monitor their networks.

   *Status Update*:  No such group was formed to our knowledge.

   3535-RECO-SNMP-WG4MONITORING:

  |   The workshop recommended that a group be formed to investigate why
  |     the current SNMP protocol does not satisfy all the monitoring
  |     requirements of operators.

   *Status Update*:  No such group was formed to our knowledge.

   3535-RECO-FOCUS-IETF-CONFIG-MECHANISMS:

  |   The workshop recommended, with strong consensus from both protocol
  |     developers and operators, that the IETF focus resources on the
  |     standardization of configuration management mechanisms.

   *Status Update*:  NETCONF [RFC6241], RESTCONF [RFC8040], CORECONF
      [I-D.ietf-core-comi], YANG.

      YANG is a transport-independent data modeling language.  It can be
      used independently of NETCONF/RESTCONF.  For example, YANG can be
      used to define abstract data structures [RFC8791] that can be
      manipulated by other protocols (e.g., [RFC9132]).

   3535-RECO-FOCUS-XML:

  |   The workshop recommended, with strong consensus from the operators
  |     and rough consensus from the protocol developers, that the
  |     IETF/IRTF should spend resources on the development and
  |     standardization of XML-based device configuration and management
  |     technologies (such as common XML configuration schemas, exchange
  |     protocols and so on).

   *Status Update*:  This recommendation was followed in base
      specifications.  This recommendation was also mirrored in other
      documents such as [RFC5706].

      However, the IETF integrated support for other encoding such as
      JSON.

   3535-RECO-NO-HTTP:

  |   The workshop recommended, with strong consensus from the operators
  |     and rough consensus from the protocol developers, that the
  |     IETF/IRTF should not spend resources on developing HTML-based or
  |     HTTP-based methods for configuration management.

   *Status Update*:  The IETF deviated from this recommendation, e.g.,
      RESTCONF [RFC8040] or CoAP Management Interface (CORECONF)
      [I-D.ietf-core-comi].

   3535-RECO-MAINTAIN-SMI-SPPI:

  |   The workshop recommended, with rough consensus from the operators
  |     and strong consensus from the protocol developers, that the IETF
  |     should continue to spend resources on the evolution of the
  |     SMI/SPPI data definition languages as being done in the SMIng
  |     working group.

   *Status Update*:  SMIng WG was concluded in 2003-04-04.

   3535-RECO-IETF2FIX-MIB:

   |   The workshop recommended, with split consensus from the operators
   |     and rough consensus from the protocol developers, that the IETF
   |     should spend resources on fixing the MIB development and
   |     standardization processs.

   *Status Update*:  The IETF dedicated some resources to fix some SNMP
      shortcomings with a focus on security (e.g., Transport Layer
      Security (TLS) Transport Model for the SNMP [RFC6353] or
      [RFC9456], HMAC-SHA-2 Authentication Protocols in User-Based
      Security Model (USM) for SNMPv3 [RFC7860]).

   Section 6 of [RFC3535] also includes the following but without
   tagging them as recommendations:

   3535-MISC-NO-CIM:

  |   The workshop had split consensus from the operators and rough
  |     consensus from the protocol developers, that the IETF should not
  |     focus resources on CIM extensions.

   *Status Update*:  The IETF didn't dedicate any resources on CIM
      extensions.

   3535-MISC-ABANDON-PIB:

 |   The workshop had rough consensus from the protocol developers
 |     that the IETF should not spend resources on COPS-PR development.
 |     So far, the operators have only very limited experience with
 |     COPS-PR.  In general, however, they felt that further development
 |     of COPS-PR might be a waste of resources as they assume that
 |     COPS-PR does not really address their requirements.

   *Status Update*:  The IETF has reclassified COPS Usage for Policy
      Provisioning [RFC3084] to Historic status.

   3535-MISC-ABANDON-COPS-PR:

 |   The workshop had rough consensus from the protocol developers
 |     that the IETF should not spend resources on SPPI PIB definitions.
 |     The operators had rough consensus that they do not care about
 |     SPPI PIBs.

   *Status Update*:  The IETF has reclassified Structure of Policy
      Provisioning Information [RFC3159], as well as three Policy
      Information Bases ([RFC3317], [RFC3318], and [RFC3571]) to
      Historic status.

4.  Observations and New Requirements

4.1.  On the Importance of Data Models

   An appealing aspect about network automation techniques is that they
   almost apply to any kind of network.  From that perspective, the
   functional component of a network automation framework that probably
   matters the most, and independent of the underlying interfaces and
   protocols, are the data models.  Concretely, data models are
   instrumental in the automation of networks, especially that they can
   provide closed-loop control for adaptive and deterministic service
   creation, delivery, and maintenance.

   Data models can be used to derive required configuration information
   for both network and service components, and state information that
   will be monitored and tracked.  Likewise, they can be used during the
   service/network management life cycle (e.g., service instantiation,
   provisioning, optimization, monitoring, diagnostic, and assurance).

   More than three decades of "Internet standardization" have shown that
   the specification of data models is not that straightforward.  This
   is because of at least two major reasons:

   *  For more than 30 years, legacy network equipment manufacturers
      have considered their technology as a competitive advantage,
      thereby leading to proprietary, vendor-specific, data models and
      the burden of vendor lock-ins.  For example, there are more YANG
      proprietary modules than standarized ones.

   *  Over the same period, operators have also developed their savoir-
      faire as a key competitive advantage.  Such savoir-faire had to
      rely upon these proprietary data models.  Operators were reluctant
      in the past to share their design and management practices.

   The situation has changed since network "softwarization" strategies
   have been disclosed by vendors and operators.  From a business
   standpoint, network "softwarization" is seen as a major
   transformation effort by operators, because of the flexibility and
   the "a la carte" approach that is promoted by "X-as-a-service" (XaaS)
   designs, "X" being network, platform, Network Slice, etc.

   XaaS designs assume the availability of data models that are
   dynamically instantiated (along with a set of relevant policies) as a
   function of the "X" (and its design, for that matter). *XaaS services
   cannot be designed, delivered, and operated without data models.*
   Standard data models are thus key as they allow to:

   *  Ease mapping among many (network/service) layers.

   *  Ease data correlation from distinct sources.

   *  Nullify (soften) CLI specifics to vendors.

   *  Support both top-down and bottom-up approaches:

   *  Accurate control loops for adaptive and deterministic service
      creation, delivery, and maintenance.

   *  Feed an intelligence that will drive appropriate actions to adjust
      the current status to align with the intended status.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-STRENGTHEN-DM:  Network softwarization can only happen
      with a strong, committed standardization effort, complemented by
      active involvement in open-source projects that facilitate access
      to code.

      Particularly, *without data models, a Network API is essentially
      useless* (see also Section 4.4).

4.2.  Fragmented Ecosystem

   The current YANG device models ecosystem is *fragmented*: some
   standards models are defined through the IETF, while similar ones are
   defined in other forums such as Openconfig or ONF.  Unlike service
   and network models, IETF-defined device models are not widely
   implemented.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-DM-RATIONALIZE:  There is a need to rationalize this
      space and avoid redundant efforts.

4.3.  The Network Becomes Consumable

   Network connectivity can support tailored services in terms of
   Service Level Obejctives (SLOs), for instance, by means of Network
   Slice Services [RFC9543].  This approach of "consuming" the network
   flexibly and dynamically is made possible by enabling means of
   exposing network capabilities to either internal or external
   applications.  Then, network management is no longer limited to
   collect network status information, but it should be now extended to
   permit the exposure of resources, capabilities, functionality, and
   associated information (e.g., inventory based data).

   NEW-OPS-REQ-EASE-EXPOSURE:  Focus on protocols and data models to
      expose network/service capabilities, network-wide services, and
      related operations.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-NW-API-DISCOVERY:  Define a reference approach/process
      for service exposure discovery (APIs discovery).

4.4.  Network APIfication

   APIs are getting momentum as means of interworking between parties,
   also at the time of providing network services.  As an example,
   [I-D.ramseyer-grow-peering-api] defines an API for dynamically
   establishing BGP peering sessions between Autonomous Systems of
   different administrative domains.  That same objective is also
   covered by the YANG data model defined in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-teas-attachment-circuit] as exemplified in
   Appendix A.10.  Tools such as YANG/OpenAPI transforms are key to
   leverage existing data models and allow for better integration and
   mapping to actual realization models.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-DM-API:  Readily available API specifications could be
      generalized from YANG modules for fast development, prototyping,
      and validation.

4.5.  Lack of Profiling

   Many NETCONF-related features are (being) specified by the IETF, but
   these features are not widely supported (e.g., YANG-Push [RFC8639]).

   NEW-OPS-REQ-GUIDE-AND-PROFILE:  The target application/applicability
      of a network management approach should be documented (e.g., edit
      profile documents that outline a set of recommendations for core/
      key features, along with appropriate justifications, will help
      foster more implementations that meet operators’ needs).  This
      also covers security management aspects of network management.
      Additionaly, consider independent compliance suites to validate
      functions/features/etc.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-ARCH:  Need to promote more arch and framework documents
      to exemplify the intended use.

      Examples of such profile documents are the various RFCs that were
      published by the Behavior Engineering for Hindrance Avoidance
      (behave) WG [BCP127].  Another approach could be to consider a
      model similar to the "Roadmap for Transmission Control Protocol
      (TCP) Specification Documents" [RFC7414].  Such a document would
      serve as a guide and reference for implementers and others seeking
      information on 'NETCONF/RESTCONF/YANG'-related RFCs.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-REASSESS:  Additionally, reassessing the value of some
      IETF proposals compared to competing or emerging solutions (e.g.,
      gRPC vs. YANG-Push) would be beneficial.

4.6.  Lack of Agile Process for (The Maintenance of) YANG Modules

   RFCs might not be suited for documenting YANG modules (it takes much
   too long, especiallly for updates).  In the meantime, there is a need
   for "reference models" and "sufficiently stable models".

   An hybrid approach might be investigated for documenting IETF-
   endorsed YANG modules, such as considering an RFC to describe the
   initial module sketch and objectives and an official IETF repository
   for maintaining intermediate YANG versions.

   By drawing a parallel between YANG data models and the concept of
   ontology used in the field of Semantic Web, the topic of YANG module
   maintenance could greatly benefit from proven methodologies in
   knowledge engineering such as [LOT2019] and automatic documentation
   tools like [Widoco2017].

   NEW-OPS-REQ-QUICK-BUT-WELL:  Develop a more agile process for the
      development and maintenance of YANG modules in the IETF.  RFCs
      might not be suited for documenting YANG modules.

4.7.  Integration Complexity

   Section 3 of [RFC3535] describes a set of network operator
   requirements.  One of the requirements is the ease of use which,
   according to Section 3.2 of [RFC6244], is addressed by NETCONF and
   YANG.  For configuration this holds true, for network observability
   it is unfortunately not yet.  This has been confirmed with a set of
   network operators asking how long it takes from subscribing YANG data
   to make it accessible to the operator.  Minutes, Hours, Days, or
   Weeks.  None of them answered Minutes or Hours.  All of them
   responded Days or Weeks.  Hinting manual post processing of YANG
   data.

   Collecting YANG metrics from networks is already a struggle due to
   late arrival of [RFC8639], [RFC8640], [RFC8641],
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-https-notif], and [I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif] for
   configured subscription transport protocols which defined YANG-Push
   in the industry.  This caused network vendors to implement
   alternative solutions to collect real-time streaming data in the
   meanwhile, such as gNMI which was proposed in 2018 in
   [I-D.openconfig-rtgwg-gnmi-spec] to the IETF but not followed up on.
   Unfortunately, these implementations differ between network Operating
   Systems due to the lack of standardization, specifically for the
   metadata which would ensure machine readability.

   When a set of network operators where asked to where operational YANG
   data needs to be integrated to, the answer homogeneously was Apache
   Kafka Message Broker and Time Series Databases.  There is a need to
   specify how YANG-Push can be integrated into Apache Kafka and
   references needed YANG-Push extensions and YANG schema registry
   development.  The YANG-Push extensions addressing needs to make YANG-
   Push messages machine readable and against semantic validate able to
   ensure a consistent data processing.

   Another challenge is that the subscribed YANG data referenced with
   datastore-subtree-filter or datastore-xpath-filter breaks semantic
   integrity which needs to be addressed by either updating Section 4 of
   [RFC8641] or proposing a new YANG module being used at the YANG-Push
   receiver.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-INTEGRATION:  Consider approaches to ease integration by-
      design (e.g., protocols and data models).

4.8.  YANG-formatted Data Manipulation

   The use of a flat tree hierarchy in YANG models may induce some
   performance issues compared to other graph models.  This can be the
   case, for example, during a path calculation on a network topology.
   Different approaches using graph theory and compatible with YANG are
   currently available, but require further experimentation to
   generalize their adoption.  For instance, OpenDaylight [ODL]
   implements an in-memory connected graph version of YANG-based data to
   enable fast breadth-first search (BFS).

   NEW-OPS-REQ-Y2KG:  Need for a reference specification to translate
      YANG-based data into the knowledge graph (KG).

   For example, [I-D.marcas-nmop-knowledge-graph-yang] and
   [I-D.tailhardat-nmop-incident-management-noria] discuss YANG-2-KG
   proposals to leverage automated reasoning and graph traversal
   techniques.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-SCALE:  Consider approaches for YANG models to scale.

4.9.  Translation and Mapping Between Service/Network and Device Models

   Navigating among multiple levels of the hierarchy (service, network,
   device) relies currently on proprietary solutions to graft and
   translate between two layers.  There is no programmatic approach to
   ensure lossless mappings.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-LOSSLESS:  Consider programmatic approaches to ensure
      lossless mappings between service/network/device data models.
      Means to detect, characterize, and expose loss may be considered.
      Note that lossless mapping is a enabler for support of
      deterministic verification, auditing, and tracing back along
      layers/models.

4.10.  (In)Consistent Data Structures in Network Protocols for Data
       Export

   Network Telemetry, as described in [RFC9232], involve a set of
   protocols.  Due to the different requirements, one Network Telemetry
   protocol doesn't address all needs.  This is mainly due to the nature
   of the subscribed data.  BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) [RFC7854] adds
   monitoring and tracing capabilities natively to the BGP process to
   minimize the processing overhead.  While IPFIX [RFC7011][RFC7012] can
   be applied according to [RFC5472] to gain visibility into the data
   and forwarding planes, due to the amount of data, sampling as defined
   in [RFC5476] and applied to IPFIX in [RFC5477] and aggregation as
   defined in [RFC7015] for IPFIX is needed to reduce the amount of
   exposed data.  While YANG-Push focuses on exposing already YANG
   modelled data, which eases the correlation among network
   configuration and operational data.

   [RFC9232] is an informational document and does not specify what
   these Network Telemetry protocols should have in common to ensure
   consistent data structures for data export.  While data types are
   fairly good aligned, a lack of metadata standardization among the
   Network Telemetry protocols is observed.  In particular describing
   from where the metrics has been exported from and timestamping.  In
   Section 4.2 of [RFC7854] timestamps are optional and sysName
   [RFC1213] is only carried in the BMP initiation message (Section 4.3
   of [RFC7854]), while the message header of IPFIX defined in
   Section 4.3 of [RFC7011] lacks the sysName definition.

   The lack of information from where the data is being pushed from is
   only known to the Network Telemetry data collection due to the
   transport session being established from the network node exporting
   the information.  When Network Telemetry messages are being
   transformed and forwarded, this information is being lost.
   Therefore, it is common among network operators to augment sysName
   and other metadata at the data collection.

   The same common principle applies to when observation timestamping is
   missing in the Network Telemetry message.  Since the data collection
   is the closest element to the network, a time stamp is added to give
   the network operator at least the information when the Network
   Telemetry message was collected.  However, since Network Telemetry
   addresses real-time streaming needs, this is often not accurate
   enough for data correlation.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-REUSABILITY:  Consider approach to ensure reuse/
      consistent data structure.

4.11.  Proprietary YANG Modules, CLI, and Limited Abstraction

   Leveraging on pluggins, propietary YANG models or even CLI is still
   the rule in many operations, sometimes forced by the need of
   operating legacy infrastructures.

   The complexity of developing and maintaining these means of operation
   is huge, as it is required to to cover many OS and vendors along the
   lifetime of the network device.

   Network models for the realization of services provide some "level"
   of abstraction and then automation.

4.12.  Distinct Networks, Distinct Management Requirements

   From the time [RFC3535] was released up to now, new kind of services
   and applications have been developed and deployed over the time, with
   very diverse, and some times contradicting, requirements.  Those
   services have been engineered on top of multi-service networks for
   the sake of efficiency and simplicity, accommodating such a variety
   of needs.  As a result, services requiring mobility, data
   replication, large capacity, adaptability, multi-path support,
   determinism, etc., coexist on the same shared network, needing from
   it mechanisms for graceful operation.

   Likewise, such diversity of services also require different
   management capabilities.  For example, session continuity,
   distribution trees, traffic engineering, congestion status
   notification, reordering, or on-time delivery impose very different
   management needs to be satisfied.

   This reality is different from the one existing at the time of
   [RFC3535], and as such, the new identified needs can require from
   novel approaches to guarantee the aforementioned co-existence of
   services.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-NEW-NEED:  Some networks have specific network management
      requirements such as the need for asynchronous operations or
      constraints on data compactness.  An example of such networks is
      Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) [RFC838] or DetNet [RFC8557].

4.13.  Implications of External Dependency

   Networks are being updated to abandon the silo approach from the past
   towards an increasing convergence.  Specifically, there are trends
   towards a tighter interaction and integration of different
   technologies previously considered as totally separated from an
   operational perspective.  Examples of that trends are the IP and
   Optical integration (e.g., the introduction of colored interfaces on
   routers), or the extension of deterministic-behavior features to
   Layer 3 networks.  This kind of convergence in most cases creates
   dependencies on the conventional network management features, which
   require to incorporate or integrate functionality from other
   technological domains.

   Such convergence is also reflected on the need of interacting and
   interworking with distinct network parts participating in the end-to-
   end service delivery.  Mobile access, fixed access, data center,
   enterprise, radio functional split (i.e., fronthaul and midhaul),
   neutral exchanges, intensive data networks (e.g., scientific academic
   networks), content distribution, etc., represent network parts
   constituent of end-to-end services that can impose dependencies of
   the management of an intermediate network.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-UNSILO:  The convergence observed in recent years also
      implies the need for an up-to-date refresh of management
      capabilities and tools for conventional networks.

      It highlights the necessity to handle the heterogeneity of data,
      configuration, and network management/requirements.

      From a YANG perspective, this involves easily mapping and relating
      the data models used to manage each specific segment.

      Resolving such issue could draw on insights from parallel
      technical fields such as knowledge engineering practices and
      concepts associated with Linked Data in the Semantic Web, areas
      where it is common to manage problems of heterogeneity and data
      reconciliation across various application domains.

4.14.  Too Much Time Between Publication of New Networking Functionality
       and the Associated YANG

   For example, [RFC8667] (IS-IS extensions for SR) was published in
   December 2019, while [I-D.ietf-isis-sr-yang] will be published ~5
   years after.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-TIMELY-DM:  Consider having YANG as part of the protocol
      specification/change where possible, or have the YANG document
      progress in parallel.  That may slow down the protocol
      specification, though.

4.15.  Lack of Implementation of Proposed Solutions

   New solutions proposed by WGs such as NETMOD and NETCONF very often
   lack an implementation or only have a partial implementation.  The
   situation has improved with the last hackathons (e.g., for YANG-
   Push), but these solutions became RFCs without a known
   implementation:

   *  YANG-Push [RFC8641]

   *  Schema-mount [RFC8528]

   *  NMDA [RFC8342]

   Schema-mount allegedly has only one known implementation because of
   the complexity of the solution.  That means the IETF most likely
   spent lots of cycles for something which won't be deployed ever.

   While hackathons have improved the situation, the availablability of
   implementation is concerning.  For open-source, 'sysrepo'/'libyang'
   are decent choices.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-READILTY-IMPLEM:  It is tempting to consider mandating at
      least one implementation.  However, there were areas which imposed
      in the past rules for implementations for I-Ds to be published as
      PS (e.g., [RFC1264]), but these rules were relaxed for reasons
      described, e.g., [RFC4794] and left it to the WGs to decide about
      the actual measures to put in place.  To date, only IDR WG has
      clear guidance on two implementations.

4.16.  Tooling & Skills

4.16.1.  Integration with "native" IT Tooling

   NEW-OPS-REQ-IT-INTEGRATION:  There is a need to ease the integration
      of low-level/network-oriented solution with native "IT tooling"
      (e.g., "https://opentelemetry.io/").

4.16.2.  IETF Support for Better YANG Integration

   NEW-OPS-REQ-IETF-TOOLS  Ease exposure of libraries and host tools
      (e.g., yangkit) to ease integration.

4.16.3.  Open-source Tools

   While there are open-source implementations for NETCONF (e.g.,
   NETOPEER), the gRPC/gNMI suite seems to have more support for tools
   on the client side.  For example, "ygot" generates structures from
   YANG models and these can easily be used by a client to configure a
   device with gNMI.  NETCONF is not supported though (we need the XML
   tags).

   NEW-OPS-REQ-CLIENT-TOOLS:  Focus on tooling is needed, especially on
      the client side.

4.16.4.  Skills

   The IETF is not the expert community in data engineering.  The
   experts are in the data industry.  Without them, integration in data
   processing chains like Data Mesh is going to be a challenge.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-BRIDGE:  Create an eco-system where data and networking
      engineers can collaborate.

4.17.  New Service Approaches

   The virtualization trend have made posible to dynamically instantiate
   Service Functions (SFs) in distributed compute facilities in the form
   of virtual machines or containers, as micro-services.  The
   instantiation of the SFs is governed by cloud management systems, as
   it is the connectivity among the different instances or micro-
   services.  That connectivity is typically realized by using overlay
   mechanisms, without any further interaction with the network.
   However, this appraoch seems to be insuficient for future services
   demanding stringent requirements in terms of SLOs.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-GLUE:  The distinct approaches followed in both the
      compute and the network environments makes necessary to define
      suitable mechanisms for enabling an efficient interplay, while
      highly automating the overall service delivery procedure.

4.18.  Many Solutions for the Same Problem, but Lack of Clear Applicably
       Guidance

   There are several solutions that were standardized for network
   management purposes.  For example, management of ACLs by means to BGP
   FlowSpec [RFC8955][RFC8956] or by means of NETCONF/YANG [RFC8519].
   There is no cross referencing between the two standards or delimits
   its applicability scope vs the other approach.

   Likewise, BGP FlowSpec did not reuse the IPFIX Information Elements.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-GUIDANCE:  The target application/applicability of a
      network management approach should be integrated in the
      specification itself.

5.  New Requirements

5.1.  Summary

   NEW-OPS-REQ-STRENGTHEN-DM:  Network softwarization can only happen
      with a strong, committed standardization effort, complemented by
      active involvement in open-source projects that facilitate access
      to code.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-DM-RATIONALIZE:  Rationalize this space and avoid
      redundant efforts (in almost all layers (IP, optic, etc.)).
      Unlike service and network models, Standard-based device models
      are not widely implemented.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-QUICK-BUT-WELL:  Develop a more agile process for the
      development and maintenance of YANG modules in the IETF.  RFCs
      might not be suited for documenting YANG modules.

      of a network management approach should be documented (e.g., edit
      profile documents that outline a set of recommendations for core/
      key features, along with appropriate justifications, will help
      foster more implementations that meet operators’ needs).  This
      also covers security management aspects of network management.
      Additionaly, consider independent compliance suites to validate
      functions/features/etc.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-ARCH:  Need to promote more arch and framework documents
      to exemplify the intended use.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-EASE-EXPOSURE:  Focus on protocols and data models to
      expose network/service capabilities, network-wide services, and
      related operations.

      specification/change where possible, or have the YANG document
      progress in parallel.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-READILY-IMPLEM:  The availablability of implementation is
      concerning.  Consider catalyst approaches to trigger more (open)
      implementations, especially during the development of protocols/
      extensions.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-DM2API:  Readily available API specifications should be
      generalized from YANG modules for fast development, prototyping,
      and validation.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-NW-API-DISCOVERY:  Define a reference approach/process
      for service exposure discovery (APIs discovery).

   NEW-OPS-REQ-REASSESS:  Reassess the value of some IETF proposals,
      including compared to competing or emerging solutions (e.g.,
      gNMI).

   NEW-OPS-REQ-BRIDGE:  Create an eco-system where data and networking
      engineers can collaborate.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-INTEGRATION:  Consider approaches to ease integration by-
      design (e.g., protocols and data models).  The integration covers
      both horizontal and vertical realms.  For example, there is a lack
      of enablement of this integration across standard bodies that
      operators are left to solve.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-LOSSLESS:  Consider programmatic approaches to ensure
      lossless mappings between service/network/device data models.
      Means to detect, characterize, and expose loss may be considered.
      Note that lossless mapping is a enabler for support of
      deterministic verification, auditing, and tracing back along
      layers/models.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-REUSABILITY:  Consider approaches to ensure reuse/
      consistent data structure across various NM segments.  This will
      ease correlating data learned from different means (IPFIX, BMP,
      SYSLOG, etc.).

   NEW-OPS-REQ-SCALE:  Consider approaches for YANG models to scale +
      protocol considerartions (transactions, touches, etc.).
      Specifically, address Telemetry scalability enhancements.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-UNSILO:  Necessity to handle the heterogeneity of data,
      configuration, and network management/requirements.  Resolving
      such issue could draw on insights from parallel technical fields
      such as knowledge engineering practices and concepts associated
      with Linked Data in the Semantic Web, areas where it is common to
      manage problems of heterogeneity and data reconciliation across
      various application domains.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-IT-INTEGRATION:  There is a need to ease the integration
      of low-level/network-oriented solution with native "IT tooling"
      (e.g., "https://opentelemetry.io/").

   NEW-OPS-REQ-ITER:  Need a velocity and approach to standardisation
      that allows for business goals to be incrementally realised.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-Y2KG:  Need for reference specifications to translate
      YANG-based data into the knowledge graph.  Sample use cases to
      illustrate the intended use should be considered as well.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-TOOLS:  Focus on tooling is needed, especially on the
      client side.  There is a need for tools that are easy to use.
      Likewise, there is need for support for multiple friendly, stable,
      and feature-rich libraries for programming languages.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-IETF-TOOLS:  Ease exposure of libraries and host tools
      (e.g., yangkit) to ease integration.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-NEW-NEED:  Some networks have specific network management
      requirements such as the need for asynchronous operations or
      constraints on data compactness.

   NEW-OPS-REQ-GLUE:  Distinct approaches followed in both the compute
      and the network environments make necessary to define suitable
      mechanisms for enabling an efficient interplay, while highly
      automating the overall service delivery procedure.

5.4.  Collaborative Prioritization

      TBC to reflect the priorities set by the WG.

      ((Including Rob's Inputs))

   *  Move much faster (NEW-OPS-REQ-QUICK-BUT-WELL, NEW-OPS-REQ-TIMELY-
      DM)

   *  Implement minimal functionality, not bells and whistles (NEW-OPS-
      REQ-GUIDE-AND-PROFILE, NEW-OPS-REQ-ITER)

   *  Have running code (NEW-OPS-REQ-READILY-IMPLEM, NEW-OPS-REQ-TOOLS)

   *  Have vendors and operators on board at the time of developing the
      solution independent compliance suite to validate things.

   *  Need to coorelating data learned from different means (IPFIX, BMP,
      Models)
