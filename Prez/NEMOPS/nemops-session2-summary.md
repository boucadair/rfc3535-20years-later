# Summary: New Requirements and Papers/Servy Mapping


|NEW Ops Requirement Label| Description| Papers| Survey |
|-------------------------|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|NEW-OPS-REQ-STRENGTHEN-DM |Network softwarization can only happen with a strong, committed standardization effort, complemented by active involvement in open-source projects that facilitate access to code|#1, #3, #4|Y|
|NEW-OPS-REQ-DM-RATIONALIZE|Rationalize this space and avoid redundant efforts. Unlike service and network models, IETF-defined device models are not widely implemented|#4|Y|
|NEW-OPS-REQ-QUICK-BUT-WELL|Develop a more agile process for the development and maintenance of YANG modules in the IETF. RFCs might not be suited for documenting YANG modules|#3, #4, #5, #8, #10|
|NEW-OPS-REQ-GUIDE-AND-PROFILE|The target application/applicability of a network management approach should be documented (e.g., edit profile documents that outline a set of recommendations for core/key features, along with appropriate justifications, will help foster more implementations that meet operatorsâ€™ needs) |#4, #10|
|NEW-OPS-REQ-ARCH|Need to promote more arch and framework documents to exemplify the intended use|#3, #5|
|NEW-OPS-REQ-EASE-EXPOSURE|Focus on protocols and data models to expose network/service capabilities, network-wide services, and related operations |#1, #3, #4, #11|Y|
|NEW-OPS-REQ-TIMELY-DM|Consider having YANG as part of the protocol specification/change where possible, or have the YANG document progress in parallel|#4|
|NEW-OPS-REQ-READILTY-IMPLEM|The availablability of implementation is concerning|#4, #10|
|NEW-OPS-REQ-DM2API|Readily available API specifications should be generalized from YANG modules for fast development, prototyping, and validation |#4|
|NEW-OPS-REQ-NW-API-DISCOVERY|Define a reference approach/process for service exposure discovery (APIs discovery)|#3, #4|
|NEW-OPS-REQ-REASSESS|Reassess the value of some IETF proposals, including compared to competing or emerging solutions (e.g., gRPC/gNMI)|#4, #9|Y|
|NEW-OPS-REQ-BRIDGE|Create an eco-system where data and networking engineers can collaborate|#4, #10|Y|
|NEW-OPS-REQ-INTEGRATION|Consider approaches to ease integration by-design (e.g., protocols and data models)|#4, #9|
|NEW-OPS-REQ-LOSSLESS|Consider programmatic approaches to ensure lossless mappings between service/network/device data models|#4, #11|
|NEW-OPS-REQ-REUSABILITY|Consider approaches to ensure reuse/consistent data structure across various NM segments|#4, #5, #7, #10, #11|
|NEW-OPS-REQ-SCALE|Consider approaches for YANG models to scale + protocol considerartions (transactions, touches, etc.)|#4, #7|
|NEW-OPS-REQ-UNSILO|Necessity to handle the heterogeneity of data, configuration, and network management/requirements. Resolving such issue could draw on insights from parallel technical fields such as knowledge engineering practices and concepts associated with Linked Data in the Semantic Web, areas where it is common to manage problems of heterogeneity and data reconciliation across various application domains|#3, #4, #8|
|NEW-OPS-REQ-IT-INTEGRATION|There is a need to ease the integration of low-level/network-oriented solution with native "IT tooling" (e.g., "https://opentelemetry.io/")|#3, #4|
|NEW-OPS-REQ-ITER|Need a velocity and approach to standardisation that allows for business goals to be incrementally realised|#5, #6, #10|
|NEW-OPS-REQ-Y2KG|Need for reference specifications to translate YANG-based data into the knowledge graph|#4, #8|Y|
|NEW-OPS-REQ-CLIENT-TOOLS|Focus on tooling is needed, especially on the client side.|#3, #4, #5, #8, #10|Y|
|NEW-OPS-REQ-IETF-TOOLS|Ease exposure of libraries and host tools (e.g., `yangkit`) to ease integration|#4|Y|
|NEW-OPS-REQ-NEW-NEED|Some networks have specific network management requirements such as the need for asynchronous operations or constraints on data compactness|#4, #10|Y|
|NEW-OPS-REQ-GLUE|Distinct approaches followed in both the compute and the network environments make necessary to define suitable mechanisms for enabling an efficient interplay, while highly automating the overall service delivery procedure.|#2, #4, #8|

Ontology Language (OWL) from the Semantic Web may serve as reference in this area."
   + (**NEW-OPS-REQ-UNSILO**) "Fixed hierarchical structure limits the modeling of complex scenarios where relationships within the data are important...graph structures provide a
more flexible structure that can accommodate any kind of data"
   + (**NEW-OPS-REQ-CLIENT-TOOLS**) "Lack of mature YANG libraries, with several efforts in different programming languages that have been abandoned or that do not keep the pace of the standards"
   + (**NEW-OPS-REQ-QUICK-BUT-WELL**) "maintenance and up-to-date documentation of the YANG models is a not agile process"
   + (**NEW-OPS-REQ-GLUE**) "Integrating additional relevant information that could be required for those applications for taking decisions on the network"


# Lower Level YANG and Protocol-related Requirements Combined with High-Level Service and Network Model Requirements

9. [Four Thoughts for How to Improve Network Management for Operators](https://www.ietf.org/slides/slides-nemopsws-paper-nemops-position-paper-kent-watsen-00.pdf)
    
   + (**NEW-OPS-REQ-REASSESS**) Promote RESTCONF with JSON encoding, obsolete NETCONF and RESTCONF's XML
   + (**NEW-OPS-REQ-GUIDE-AND-PROFILE**) NMDA should be mandatory to implement in the next version of NETCONF and RESTCONF protocols
   + (**NEW-OPS-REQ-INTEGRATION**) There should be a "library" of adaptors to transform standards-based data models to the native data model supported by devices
   + (**NEW-OPS-REQ-INTEGRATION**) Device-adapters to send the device-specific data to the device (which only supports CLI or SNMP) via its CLI

10. [Device Network Management - Current Status, and Future Direction](https://www.ietf.org/slides/slides-nemopsws-paper-device-network-management-current-status-and-future-direction-00.txt)
    
   + NETCONF-next:
      * (**NEW-OPS-REQ-GUIDE-AND-PROFILE**) Be optimized to specify the minimum functionality required to manage network devices using YANG.
      * (**NEW-OPS-REQ-GUIDE-AND-PROFILE**) Make all extra functionality optional, perhaps moving them to a separate document (e.g., XPath filtering)
      * (**NEW-OPS-REQ-GUIDE-AND-PROFILE**) Consider if there is any legacy features that are no longer useful and could be removed altogether (e.g., shared candidate)
      * (Protocol maintenance; not specific to the WS) Model all NETCONF RPC operations in YANG data models.
      * (**NEW-OPS-REQ-NEW-NEED**) Support for JSON encoding of YANG data by default, but also allowing support for CBOR and XML.
   + YANG-next:
      * (Protocol maintenance; not specific to the WS) Merging in the core versioning changes.
      * (Protocol maintenance; not specific to the WS) Any small changes to the language that significantly improve modelling of difficult cases.
      * (**NEW-OPS-REQ-REUSABILITY**) Any small generalizations to the language that make it more widely usable (e.g., add a base float type).
      * (**NEW-OPS-REQ-GUIDE-AND-PROFILE**) Deprecation of functionality that adds unnecessary complexity, to be removed in future version (e.g., sub-modules).
      * (Protocol maintenance; not specific to the WS) Any bug fixes or omissions from the existing specification.
   + (**NEW-OPS-REQ-GUIDE-AND-PROFILE**) Develop a mechanism to define sets of IETF and other SDO YANG models that are known to work well together.
   + (**NEW-OPS-REQ-QUICK-BUT-WELL**) Define a more efficient mechanism for evolving YANG data models. Rather than having all of the YANG modules residing in RFCs, that
     are slow and expensive to update, it would be better to have a working copy of the IETF YANG models with fixes and enhancements applied, stored in github 
     and readily available for use.  Overtime, as these models become stable they could be published in RFCs, if necessary.
   + (**NEW-OPS-REQ-QUICK-BUT-WELL**) The IETF should consider whether assets, such as YANG models, should be specified in documents at all, of whether the RFCs should only document the 
     abstract overview of the YANG data model
   + The IETF should check whether the YANG data models are complete to solve particular standard deployments and configuration.
   + (**NEW-OPS-REQ-BRIDGE**) Collaboration between operators, vendors, and universities.
   + (**NEW-OPS-REQ-ITER**) The IETF should focus on staged "minimum-viable-product" deliverables, and take smaller steps to achieve the minimum agreed functionality
   + (**NEW-OPS-REQ-READILTY-IMPLEM** and **NEW-OPS-REQ-CLIENT-TOOLS**) IETF should focus more on the the availability of open source solutions

11. [Composable, Declarative, Reproducible, Verifiable Network and Service Configurations](https://www.ietf.org/slides/slides-nemopsws-paper-composable-declarative-reproducible-verifiable-network-and-service-configurations-00.pdf)
    
   + (Protocol maintenance; not specific to the WS) Improve the YANG language and fix known limitations as well as add a package mechanism to YANG
   + (**NEW-OPS-REQ-EASE-EXPOSURE**) Shift the focus from device configuration to network and service configuration:
      - (**NEW-OPS-REQ-REUSABILITY**) enable to define composable and reusable configuration components for specific services that do compose well into a larger network and service configurations.
      - (**NEW-OPS-REQ-LOSSLESS**) tackle declarative network and service configuration and allows the expression of specific deployment constraints which may translate to constraints that must be met by device configuration
      - (**3535**) support a smooth transition between network configurations, e.g., bring all systems back to network configuration X
      - (**3535**) support network-wide configurations that are verifiable configuration and resilient against certain types of failures or robustness against certain attacks.
